# react-aws-vault-database
A react application with database using aws vault
Integrating AWS Vault keys to use with a database in the cloud typically involves a few steps:

1. **Setting up AWS Vault**: Ensure AWS Vault is set up and configured on your machine.
2. **Storing and retrieving AWS credentials securely**: Use AWS Vault to manage your AWS credentials securely.
3. **Configuring your React app**: Use the AWS SDK or another library to access your database.

### Step 1: Setting up AWS Vault

First, ensure you have AWS Vault installed. You can install it via Homebrew on macOS:

```sh
brew install aws-vault
```

### Step 2: Storing AWS Credentials

Store your AWS credentials securely using AWS Vault:

```sh
aws-vault add <profile-name>
```

You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

### Step 3: Configuring Your React App

In your React app, you will need to interact with your cloud database. This example assumes you are using AWS DynamoDB. Install the AWS SDK:

```sh
npm install aws-sdk
```

### Step 4: Using AWS Vault in Your Development Environment

To ensure your environment has access to the credentials managed by AWS Vault, you can run your development server with AWS Vault:

```sh
aws-vault exec <profile-name> -- npm start
```

### Step 5: Accessing the Database from React

Create a utility to configure AWS SDK and interact with your database. Ensure your credentials are correctly configured.

**aws-config.js:**

```javascript
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

// Configure the region
AWS.config.update({ region: 'us-west-2' }); // Update to your region

// Create DynamoDB service object
const dynamoDB = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

export const fetchData = async (tableName) => {
  const params = {
    TableName: tableName,
  };

  try {
    const data = await dynamoDB.scan(params).promise();
    return data.Items;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data from DynamoDB:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### Step 6: Using the Utility in Your React Component

Use the utility function in your React components to fetch data from DynamoDB.

**App.js:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { fetchData } from './aws-config';

const App = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadItems = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await fetchData('YourTableName');
        setItems(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading items:', error);
      }
    };

    loadItems();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Items from DynamoDB</h1>
      <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: In a production environment, avoid hardcoding AWS credentials. Instead, use environment variables or a secrets management service.
- **AWS IAM Roles**: For production, use IAM roles and policies to manage permissions securely.

### Deployment

When deploying your React application, make sure your deployment environment has access to the necessary AWS credentials and permissions, either through environment variables, IAM roles, or other secure methods.

By following these steps, you can integrate AWS Vault keys with your React application to interact with a cloud database securely.
